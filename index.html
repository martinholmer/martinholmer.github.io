<h1>Martin Holmer</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
  I have a Ph.D. in economics from MIT and decades of experience
  designing, developing, testing and using microsimulation models that
  estimate the effects of changes in public policy.
</p>

<p>
  From 2015 to 2019, I was the lead developer
  of <a href="https://PSLmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/"
  target="_blank">Tax-Calculator</a>, an open-source static US federal
  income and payroll tax microsimulation model written in Python.  In
  2018, the World Bank asked me to begin working with the Tax Policy Research
  Unit of the Ministry of Finance in New Delhi to adapt Tax-Calculator
  to simulate the Indian personal income tax.
  That project continues to be developed in this
  <a href="https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc#tax-microsimulation-model-for-india"
  target="_blank">TPRU-India repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Over several decades before 2016, I designed and developed, for use
  by federal government agencies and non-profit organizations, a suite
  of dynamic microsimulation models &mdash; known as
  the <a href="http://www.polsim.com/" target="_blank">PSG Models</a>
  &mdash; that simulate payroll taxes and social security benefits as
  well as lifetime accumulations of employer-sponsored pension benefits.
  The models are written in C++ and have a graphical user interface
  that facilitates their use.
</p>

<p>
  For earlier work, see my complete vita in
  this <a href="http://www.polsim.com/MRH_vita.pdf"

<h3>Services</h3>

<p>
I can provide design advice, development assistance, validation
testing or ease-of-use evaluation related to your microsimulation
model through the Policy Simulation Group, which is my consulting
company.  The consulting engagement can have a narrow or broad focus,
and be short-term or long-term, depending on your needs.  To discuss
options, contact me via email at martin DOT holmer AT gmail DOT com.
