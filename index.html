<h1>Martin Holmer</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
  I have a Ph.D. in economics from MIT and decades of experience
  designing, developing, testing and using microsimulation models that
  estimate the effects of changes in public policy.
</p>

<p>
  From 2015 to 2019, I was the lead developer
  of <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator"
  target="_blank">Tax-Calculator</a>, an open-source static US federal
  income and payroll tax microsimulation model written in Python.  In
  2018, the World Bank asked me to begin working with the Tax Policy
  Research Unit of the Ministry of Finance in New Delhi to adapt
  Tax-Calculator to simulate the Indian individual income tax.
</p>

<p>
  My experience working with World Bank staff in Washington and
  Ministry of Finance staff in New Delhi has led to the development of
  an open-source tax microsimulation
  <a href="https://chiselapp.com/user/PSG/repository/Tax-Analyzer-Framework"
  target="_blank">framework</a> that supports rapid development with
  minimal coding of new tax models that can be used at the command line
  without any computer programming.  There is also a graphic user
  interface to framework models.  This framework has been used to
  develop a
  <a href="https://chiselapp.com/user/PSG/repository/USW-Tax-Analyzer"
  target="_blank">wealth tax model</a> for the US.  In addition, a US
  federal income and payroll tax model and a Massachusetts income tax
  model have been developed using this framework.  Also, the framework
  has been used to develop personal and corporate income tax models
  for several countries including Malaysia, Albania, and Moldova.
</p>

<p>
  Over several decades before 2016, I designed and developed, for use
  by federal government agencies and non-profit organizations, a suite
  of dynamic microsimulation models &mdash; known as the PSG Models
  &mdash; that simulate payroll taxes and social security benefits as
  well as lifetime accumulations of employer-sponsored pension
  benefits.  The models are written in C++ and have a graphical user
  interface that facilitates their use.
</p>

<h3>Services</h3>

<p>
I can provide design advice, development assistance, validation
testing or ease-of-use evaluation related to your microsimulation
model through the Policy Simulation Group, which is my consulting
company.  The consulting engagement can have a narrow or broad focus,
and be short-term or long-term, depending on your needs.  To discuss
options, contact me via email at martin DOT holmer AT gmail DOT com.
