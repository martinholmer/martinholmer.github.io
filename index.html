<h1>Martin Holmer</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
  I have a Ph.D. in economics from MIT and decades of experience
  designing, developing and using microsimulation models that estimate
  the effects of changes in public policy.
</p>

<p>
  Since 2015, I have been the main developer
  of <a href="https://PSLmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/"
  target="_blank">Tax-Calculator</a>, an open-source static federal
  income and payroll tax microsimulation model written in Python.  In
  2018, the World Bank asked us to work with the Tax Policy Research
  Unit of the Ministry of Finance in New Delhi to adapt Tax-Calculator
  to simulate the Indian personal income tax, goods and services tax,
  and corporate income tax.  That project is maintained in this
  <a href="https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc#tax-microsimulation-model-for-india"
  target="_blank">TPRU-India repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Over several decades before 2016, I designed and developed, for use
  by federal government agencies and non-profit organizations, a suite
  of dynamic microsimulation models &mdash; known as
  the <a href="http://www.polsim.com/" target="_blank">PSG Models</a>
  &mdash; that simulate payroll taxes and social security benefits as
  well the lifetime accumulation of employer-sponsored pension
  benefits.  The models are written in C++ and have a graphical user
  interface that facilitates their use.
</p>

<h3>Services</h3>

<p>
I can provide design advice, development assistance or usage
evaluation related to your microsimulation model through the Policy
Simulation Group, which is my consulting company.  The consulting
engagement can be short-term or long-term depending on your needs.  To
discuss options, contact me via email at martin DOT holmer AT gmail
